# Introduction to GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform that allows users to store and manage their code. It is built on top of Git, a popular version control system. GitHub allows users to collaborate on code and easily track changes.

## Git vs GitHub

Git is a version control system that allows users to track changes to their code over time. GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git as its version control system. While Git is a command-line tool, GitHub provides a web-based interface for managing code.

# Using GitHub

## Understanding the GitHub Flow

The GitHub Flow is a workflow that is commonly used for collaborating on code. It involves creating a branch, making changes, committing those changes, and then creating a pull request to merge those changes back into the main branch.

## Repositories

A repository is a collection of files that is stored on GitHub. It can be public or private and can be used to manage code for a project.

## Cloning, Committing, and Pushing

Cloning a repository allows users to create a local copy of the code. Once changes have been made to the code, they can be committed and pushed back to the repository.

## Branches

A branch is a version of the code that is created to allow users to make changes without affecting the main branch. This can be useful for working on new features or fixing bugs.

## Forks

Forking a repository creates a copy of the repository that is separate from the original. This allows users to make changes to the code without affecting the original repository.

## Pull Requests

A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another. It can be used to review and discuss changes before they are merged into the main branch.

## Issues

Issues are used to track bugs or feature requests. They can be assigned to specific users and can be used to discuss and track progress on a particular issue.

## User Profile

A user profile is a page that displays information about a user, including their repositories, contributions, and followers.

## Using Markdown in GitHub

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to format text in GitHub. It can be used to create headings, lists, links, and more.

## GitHub Community

The GitHub community is a group of developers who use GitHub to collaborate on code. It includes users from around the world who contribute to open source projects and share their own code.

## Starring Repositories

Starring a repository allows users to keep track of repositories that they are interested in. It can be used to easily find and access repositories that a user has starred.

## Following Users

Following a user allows users to receive updates about that user's activity on GitHub. This can be useful for staying up-to-date on the work of other developers.

## Browsing GitHub Explore

GitHub Explore is a feature that allows users to browse popular repositories and topics. It can be used to discover new projects and find inspiration for new projects.
